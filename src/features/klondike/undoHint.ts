// Discovery hint for the undo scrubber (see
// docs/product/undo-scrubber-hint/undo-scrubber-hint.md).
//
// Product reasoning for the thresholds (from the original user prompt + v2 follow-up):
// - Lifetime gate: some users barely undo; showing the hint early would be cognitive
//   overload, especially right after install. Only proven undo users qualify.
// - Escalating streaks (v2): a single undo doesn't benefit from the scrubber. The
//   scrubber shines when walking back several moves in a row to explore a different
//   line of play. Up to 3 showings total, each requiring a longer streak AND a later
//   game than the previous one — the escalation keeps repeat hints from feeling naggy
//   while still catching users who missed the earlier ones.
// - Scrub consumption (v2): users who demonstrably already use the scrubber (a scrub
//   session that ended at a different timeline position) shouldn't be taught what they
//   already know — each successful scrub silently consumes one remaining hint.
//
// v5 (2026-09-09, rewind-to-winnable plan): thresholds loosened from 50 / 10-20-30 to
// 8 / 3-6-9. WHY — the old schedule was so conservative the hint essentially never
// fired: it demanded 50 lifetime undo TAPS, then a 10-undo streak inside a single
// deal, then 20 and 30 in three DIFFERENT deals. A player can use the app for weeks
// and never see it (this is not theoretical — a player wrote in believing the
// scrubber was a press-and-hold, i.e. having never been taught the real gesture).
// A hint that never shows teaches nothing, which is strictly worse than one that
// shows a little early.
// - Lifetime 8: still filters out "barely undoes", which is all the gate was ever
//   for, but reaches a normal player within their first sessions instead of never.
// - Streaks 3/6/9: three consecutive undos is already the point where dragging beats
//   tapping — it is the shortest walk-back where the scrubber pays off. Ten in a row
//   is a rare marathon, so gating the FIRST showing on it aimed the hint at exactly
//   the players least likely to need it.
// These are not new numbers: the v2 on-device smoke (2026-07-07, see the plan doc)
// was run at lifetime>0 / streaks 3/6/9 and all seven checks passed, including the
// escalation and the exhaustion cases. The shipped 50 / 10-20-30 values were a
// conservative guess that was never validated as a *discoverable* schedule.
// The stop-teaching-proven-users behaviour (consumeHintForScrub) is unchanged and
// carries the anti-nag load: anyone who actually scrubs still burns hints silently.
