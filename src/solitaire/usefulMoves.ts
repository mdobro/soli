// Classic "useful move" enumeration (hints plan, F11) — the pure-TS heuristic
// behind the Microsoft-style "no more useful moves" warning AND the Hint
// button's classic fallback when the solver has no winning line. Research:
// docs/product/hints/hints-and-unwinnable-warning.md, sections "Classic
// no-more-moves heuristic research" + "Microsoft-style stuck warning — deep
// dive" (2026-07-23). Blend of Aisleriot's exclusions and PySolFC's stuck
// filter, made exact for this single ruleset.
//
// Counted as useful (in priority order — findFirstUsefulMove returns the
// first hit, which doubles as the classic hint):
//   1. tableau top → foundation
//   2. waste top → foundation
//   3. waste top → tableau (incl. king → empty column)
//   4. full-run tableau→tableau moves that reveal a face-down card or free a
//      column (king-based runs with nothing beneath are skipped — they can
//      only shuffle empty→empty, the classic no-op)
//   5. partial-run splits, only when the card they expose plays to a
//      foundation right now (PySolFC step020 — cuts the equal-rank-run false
//      warnings without counting pure rearrangements)
//   6. draw — exact reachable-stock simulation (draw 1–5, unlimited recycles)
// Excluded on purpose, matching every classic app: foundation→tableau digs
// and non-revealing rearrangements. The solver-proven unwinnable warning is
// the separate, stronger feature; this heuristic is additionally CONFIRMED by
// a solver call before the stuck warning ever shows (see useHint).
//
// Everything here reads only face-up knowledge a player has (face-down cards
// are never inspected — "we do not cheat"), stays allocation-light, and runs
// in microseconds: worst case a few hundred comparisons plus a ≤ ~50-tap
// stock simulation.

// waste card regroups the next pass), so this must be re-run fresh after every
// committed move — never cache across moves.
//
// Model: cards surface in a fixed "entry order" — the rest of the current
// stock in draw order (array end first), and after a recycle the whole pile in
// the order cards originally entered the waste (the waste array is append-only
// between recycles, so its array order IS entry order; recycling flips it back
// so its bottom is drawn first, then the current stock repeats). Each tap
// takes the next `drawCount` cards of the sequence and the LAST of that group
// is the visible waste top (draw groups land reversed on the waste). Every
// pass after the first recycle is identical (no plays happen in-simulation),
// so exactly two passes cover all reachable configurations — the "≤ 2 passes"
// bound from the research section. Exported for unit tests (the draw-3
// phase-shift fixtures assert on it).
