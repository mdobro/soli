# scripts/android-ready.sh [--keep-awake] — one preflight/recovery command for
# the physical Android phone, for the POST-build iterative-driving loop
# (deep links + agent-device over wireless adb).
#
# Built on the SAME discovery/pinning as `yarn release`: it sources
# scripts/lib/adb-discovery.sh (server-ownership repair, mDNS/env-target
# candidate collection, bounded restart-and-retry, tcpip :5555 pinning) and
# adds what the driving loop needs on top: wake, unlock (via the local-only
# unlock script when present), optional keep-awake. Pinning is included on
# purpose — port rotation after a doze is the root cause of the dropped
# connections this command exists to recover from, and pin_tcpip_port
# short-circuits when the serial is already <ip>:5555. No daemons and no
# `svc power stayon` — the screen-timeout restore stays a printed command.
